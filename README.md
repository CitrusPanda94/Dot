# FoundationPress



This is a starter-theme for WordPress based on Zurb's [Foundation for Sites 6](https://foundation.zurb.com/sites.html), the most advanced responsive (mobile-first) framework in the world. The purpose of FoundationPress, is to act as a small and handy toolbox that contains the essentials needed to build any design. FoundationPress is meant to be a starting point, not the final product.

Please fork, copy, modify, delete, share or do whatever you like with this.
